1
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,190
I killed Sirius Black!

2
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,610
He's back.

3
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,340
The police are continuing
with the investigation...

4
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,550
...into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.

5
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,430
Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.

6
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,270
The surrounding area remains closed.

7
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,600
The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...

8
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,190
"Harry Potter."

13
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,790
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

14
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,750
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.

15
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,050
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.

94
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,900
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

95
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,480
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

98
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,580
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

99
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,790
She was, truthfully, very pretty, that girl.
